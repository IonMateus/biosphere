## 🧭 Summary

**BioSphere** was developed to make exploring NASA’s bioscience research easier, more interactive, and visually engaging.  
The platform gathers **608 scientific publications** and displays them in a **dynamic 2D layout**, where each article connects to others through shared topics.

This visual network enables users to:
- See relationships between studies at a glance.  
- Discover new connections across NASA’s space biology research.  
- Search by keywords, authors, or time periods.  
- Instantly visualize related publications highlighted on the canvas.

By offering a clear and interactive way to navigate NASA’s scientific output, BioSphere helps researchers **save time**, **uncover meaningful connections**, and **strengthen the quality and impact** of their research.

## 🧬 Project Overview

**BioSphere** is an interactive web platform that enhances the exploration of biological research articles published by NASA.  
It tackles the challenge of navigating and connecting a large volume of scientific papers by **transforming them into a visual network**.

Instead of browsing long static lists, users interact with a **2D canvas of interconnected articles**, where:
- Each **card** represents a publication.  
- Each **line** indicates conceptual similarity.  

This visual structure makes exploring complex scientific topics **intuitive, engaging, and insightful**.

Another useful aspect of the plataform is the ability to copy a pre-formated citation for each article with a button. Thos save researchs time and effort when referencing sources in scientific reports, papers or articles. Instead of manually formating citations, users can quickly retrive them already formatted, making the writing process more efficient and helping ensure accuracy in academic researches.

In this project, it's also possible to navigate between analytical views about the publications, such as topic evolution, citation trends, and main institutions in research.

## 🧠 Technical Details

The data foundation was built from **608 biology-related NASA publications**, extracted and processed in **Python**.  
For each article, the code collected:
- Title, abstract, authors, keywords, citations, and publication year.  
- The most representative terms within the text (for similarity computation).  

The resulting dataset (≈400,000 lines) powers the two main sections:

### 🔍 Search Page
- Filter and visualize articles by **keywords**, **authors**, or **publication period**.  
- Dynamically highlight connected publications.
- Copy pre-formatted citations with one click to streamline scientific referencing.

### 📊 Insights Page
- Analytical views: **topic evolution**, **citation trends**, and **leading authors**.  
- Helps identify research directions and collaboration networks.

## ⚙️ Correlation Between Articles

The similarity network is computed in the `buildSimilarityGraph` function (`cards.js`) using a **multilayered affinity model**:

| Feature | Weight | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Token similarity | 65% | Jaccard similarity between token sets (title, abstract, keywords). |
| Keyword overlap | ≤35% | Shared normalized terms increase connection strength. |
| Author overlap | ≤25% | Shared surnames strengthen links. |
| Journal bonus | +0.12 | Same journal adds constant affinity boost. |
| Temporal proximity | ≤1 | Close publication years increase similarity. |

A **dynamic threshold (~45th percentile)** ensures balanced density—avoiding both overcrowding and isolation—forming thematic clusters with textual, authorial, and temporal coherence.

## 🚀 Impact and Differentiation

Traditional databases present papers in linear lists, limiting the perception of relationships.  
BioSphere redefines this approach by **spatially mapping scientific knowledge**, allowing users to *see* how ideas interconnect.

This shift offers:
- **Immediate recognition** of clusters and emerging topics.  
- **Identification of research gaps** and potential collaborations.  
- A more **creative and exploratory** experience of scientific discovery.

The system is **scalable**, ready to handle tens of thousands of publications across fields — unlocking powerful, data-driven insight into the global scientific landscape.

## 🤖 Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI tools were **not used to generate or modify NASA content**.  
Their role was purely **assistive**, focused on:
- Text correction, translation, and refinement.  
- Supporting code writing in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

All AI-generated code suggestions (via GPT and Copilot) were:
- **Reviewed, adapted, and improved** by the team.  
- Used **under direct human supervision and creative control**.

All conceptual, functional, and structural decisions were made entirely by the **human team**.

## 📚 Resource Utilized

This project was built using the following curated list of **608 open-access Space Biology publications**:  
[SB Publications Dataset](https://github.com/jgalazka/SB_publications/tree/main)  

> Note: The dataset provides only links to the publications.  
> All metadata extraction, including titles, abstracts, authors, keywords, citations, and publication years, was performed by the BioSphere team to create the dataset used for network visualization and analytical insights.
